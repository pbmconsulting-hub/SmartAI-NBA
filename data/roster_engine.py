# FILE: data/roster_engine.py
# PURPOSE: Centralised active-roster and injury resolution engine.
#          Uses nba_api as the single authoritative data source for
#          both roster and injury data.
#
# DATA SOURCES (in priority order):
#   1. nba_api live Injuries      — daily injury designations (Out/GTD/Doubtful)
#   2. nba_api CommonTeamRoster   — authoritative roster (trades/signings)
#
# FILTERING RULES:
#   - Hard-exclude: Out / Inactive / IR / Injured Reserve / Doubtful (< 25% chance)
#   - Flag (keep with warning): GTD / Day-to-Day / Questionable / Probable
#   - Active: everything else
#   - Two-way / G-League assigned players are always excluded from rosters
#
# USAGE:
#   from data.roster_engine import RosterEngine
#   engine = RosterEngine()
#   engine.refresh(["LAL", "BOS"])
#   active = engine.get_active_roster("LAL")   # → ["LeBron James", ...]
#   ok, reason = engine.is_player_active("LeBron James", "LAL")
